-memoization: store values we repeatedly use
 -how:
  -pass a list to store values to a method
  -check if the value is valid before calc
  -store the value after before return
 -can raise stack overflow

-tabulation: bottom-up; use returned values to calc larger values
 -how:
  -create a list(or other collections) and fill it up from the bottom

-work with pen and paper and draw a pseudo code; don't work just with brain
