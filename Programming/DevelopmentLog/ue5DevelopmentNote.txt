-How to build manually in Visual Code:
 UE5 project right click -> Set up as a start project -> debug -> start a new instance

-Those builds fail when there are errors in code. check your code thoroughly

-Don't forget to include a right header file once you have forward declaration

-When LookUp doesn't work, check use pawn control rotation in springarm component

-To limit the pitch rotation of camera:
 set the value of APlayerCameraManager::ViewPitchMax

-Tried to separate movement functions from character class but it was unable to sett up enhanced input system
 in a actor component. Getting character, pawn, controller pointer of a player in the component was problemetic.
 
 -This plan is dismissed: movement methods in character class make sense

-In C++, initializing reference with default constructor is not allowed

-TUniquePtr<> unreal smart ptr 
 cannot be initialized w/ incomplete type -> include header file
 -> probly b/c TUniquePtr<> cannot initialize destructor or delete function for incomplete type

-Only classes with UCLASS() are displayed in the editor

-can easily use abstract class by UCLASS(Abstract)

-During runtime, every Unreal object creates CDO(Class Default Object) -> cannot compile with c++ pure virtual
 Pure virtual in unreal: virtual int Foo() PURE_VIRTUAL(Foo::Foo, return 0; );

-USTRUCT([Specifier, Specifier, ...])
 struct FStructName
 { 
 	GENERATED_BODY()
 };
 Specifier:
 Atomic: show up on the editor details panel
 BluprintType: can be used in blueprints

-GENERATED_BODY(): pastes code generated by UnrealHeaderTool (UHT) contained in HeaderFileName.generated.h to class or struct deceleration, which is required for UObject to properly function
                           UHT maps your class and generate registration code to register the class to its reflection system and include helpful functions
