error: src refspec master does not match any
1. master branch doesn't exist or not set to default
2. try to push w/o pull while local repository and remote repository have diff info
>> to prevent the removal of info exclusively exists in remote repository
3. it is empty directory or try to push w/o commit

fatal: not a valid object name: 'master'
-when there is no initial commit -> make first commit

error: inflate: data stream error (incorrect data check)
-reason: .git hash file is broken
-solution: git fsck --full to detect broken files -> delete broken files -> git reset

-git fsck --full: investigate git repository

-when repository is corrupted
$ git fsck --full

-> repository corruption
-> blob 4b9458b3 is missing, and that the tree 2d9263c6 points to it

-> examine the tree

-if you identify the file name and its directory, 
 and the missing copy is the same as the copy of the working tree:
 $ git hash-object -w somedirectory/myfile
 -> create and store a blob object with the contents of somedirectory/myfile,
    and output the SHA-1 of that object.
 else:
 $ git log --raw --all --full-history -- somedirectory/myfile
 -> check the file versions
 then -> $ git hash-object -w <recreated-file>

-To clone git repository:
 git clone <url>

-diff between clone and fork:
 forking: creates a separate copy on a remote server
 cloning: downloads the entire repository onto your computer

-fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
 ->git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

-Managing large files requires a different approach
